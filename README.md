# -Unsupervised-Reinforcement Project

The team has been approached by a law enforcement security company ABC that would like to incorporate facial recognition and identification into their system. 
ABC has provided your team with umist_cropped.mat dataset to train your system.

umist_cropped.mat Dataset
The umist_cropped dataset is a collection of images of human faces taken from the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology (UMIST) database.
Each image is a grayscale image that has been cropped to be aligned with the center of the face. 
The dataset consists of 20 different people. Each image is cropped to a size of 112x92 pixels and is grayscale.
The images are stored in a mat file, which is a standard format for storing and sharing data. 
This dataset is ideal for developing and testing facial recognition and identification systems, as it contains a wide variety of faces and expressions to work with.
